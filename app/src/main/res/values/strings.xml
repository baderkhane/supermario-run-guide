    <string name="levels"><![CDATA[<b>Super Mario Run World 1</b><br/> Super Mario Run is listed as a free game in the App Store, but the free version is really just a demo. The game’s first three levels, 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3, are available completely free of charge, but to finish the end of World 1 and complete your first castle stage, you’ll have to fork over $10. This one-time payment gets you access to all six of the game’s worlds — 24 stages in total.  ]]></string>
